Two extensions for Gnome Shell that I created to enhance its user experience.

## WindowOverlay Icons Extension
Adds application icons to the windows overview (in Activities menu)

See demo: https://youtu.be/LxxNI3HeCe4

## HistoryManager Prefix Search Extension
Use PageUp and PageDown to move in history of eg. RunCommand (Alt+F2) or Looking Glass according the command prefix.
Works with all components which use `imports.misc.history.HistoryManager`.

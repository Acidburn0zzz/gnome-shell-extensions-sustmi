Two extensions for Gnome Shell that I built to enhance its User Experience.

## WindowOverlay Icons extension
Adds application icons to the windows overview (in Activities menu)

## HistoryManager Prefix Search
Use PageUp and PageDown to move in history of eg. RunCommand (Alt+F2) or Looking Glass according the command prefix.
Works with all components which use `imports.misc.history.HistoryManager`.
